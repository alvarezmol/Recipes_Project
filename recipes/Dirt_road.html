    <p>Dolly Parton and Rachel Parton Geroge share their unique twist on a classic martini in their cookbook "Good Lookin' Cookin'." In addition to olives, the sisters add in iced tea and pickled vegetables.</p>
    <p>Olives come to mind for just about everybody when they think of a martini, but why stop there? We like the taste that tea and pickled vegetables give this, Rachel's version of the classic drink. Giardiniera is a colorful combination of pickled carrots, cauliflower, celery, pickles, red bell peppers, and onions that make this martini especially good lookin'.</p>
